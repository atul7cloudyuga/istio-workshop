# Istio Architecture and Building Blocks

## Architecture

Istio service mesh provides a modular architecture similar to kubernetes logically splitted into a **control plane** and a **data plane**:

**The control plane**: is the brain of the main network who manage, control, and supervise the network of microservies.

**The data plane**: deployed within the services forming the service mesh as sidecars and acting as proxy.
