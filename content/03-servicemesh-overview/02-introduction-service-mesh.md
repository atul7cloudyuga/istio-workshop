# Introducing Service Mesh


A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. Itâ€™s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application.


## Service mesh definition
Service Mesh: a set of workload with a common administrative control.

Istio goals: develop an open technology that provides a uniform way to connect, secure, manage and monitor a network of microservices regardless of the platform source or vendor.


In recent years evolving software development practices have fundamentally changed applications. These changes have impacted the requirements to the underlying infrastructure, tools, and processes to manage applications properly throughout the lifecycle. Applications transformed from large monolithic code bases to collections of many small services, loosely coupled together into what is called a microservices architecture. Driven by the desire to ship more software, faster in a way that is portable across infrastructure, the resulting benefits of more agile organizations can be seen all around us, from the smallest startups to the largest of enterprises.
