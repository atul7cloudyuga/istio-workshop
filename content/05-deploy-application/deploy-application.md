## Install Skaffold:

```
mkdir skaffold && cd skaffold
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-darwin-amd64
sudo chmod +x skaffold
cd ..
export PATH="$PATH:/technical/github/istio-workshop/releases/skaffold/"
```


Check that skaffold is installed:
```
skaffold version
v0.37.0
```
 //TOOD: Add illustration schema fo skaffold




{{% notice tip %}}
if you are using Google Cloud console, you haven't to deploy skaffold. it is alredy coming within the VM.
{{% /notice%}}

## Deploy

1. Enable Google Container Registry (GCR) on your GCP project and configure the docker CLI to authenticate to GCR:

```
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
```

```
gcloud auth configure-docker -q
```
You should a confirmation that Docker configuration file updated.


## Application namespace

1. We will create
```
kubectl create namespace hipster-app
```

2. Switch the context to the created namespace:

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=hipster-app
```


## Build image and Deploy with Skaffold

1. Clone docker repository
```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
cd microservices-demo
```

2. In the root of this repository, run the following command:
//run skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID], where [PROJECT_ID] is your GCP project ID.

```
cd microservices-demo/
skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID
```

```

**Note for presenter**: this will take almost % min. you need to present the next topic meanwhile.

This command:

- builds the container images
- pushes them to GCR
- applies the ./kubernetes-manifests deploying the application to Kubernetes.

{{% notice note %}}
if you do not have docker installed locally, run skaffold with `-p gcp` option. This allows building and pushing the images on Google Container Builder without requiring docker installed on the developer machine.
```
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
skaffold run -p gcb --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID
```
