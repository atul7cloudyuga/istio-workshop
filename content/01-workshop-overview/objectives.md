# Workshop objectives

Understand the capabilities of Istio Service Mesh technology to manage, secure and observe container-based solutions in a Kubernetes based environment.


You should be able to by the end of this workshop to:

- Understand service mesh and the capabilities it offers to manage microservices.
- Understand the technology solution (Istio) high level architecture and components.
- Install Istio service mesh on the top of a Kubernetes cluster.
- Interact with service mesh using istioctl command line tool.
- Manage microservices behaviour using Istio.
- Use Istio dashboards to monitor and debug microservices.
- Debugging microservices running within the mesh network.


<!-- - How to install Istio service mesh on the top of a Kubernetes cluster.
- Managigng microservices concerns in the declarative appraoch such as: traffic splitting, circuit breaker, retry strategy...
- Use Ingress and Egress gateways to handle communication with the external world.
- Achieve full traceability and observability of the running workload out of box.
- Secure microservices communication using mTLS and apply RBAC at the service level.
- Debugging microservices running within the mesh network. -->
